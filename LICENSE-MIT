IMPORTANT: grunt-contrib-jshint (the glue code for executing
JSHint from Grunt) is covered by the MIT license terms below.

JSHint itself is obviously essential to use grunt-contrib-jshint.

JSHint is covered by a more restrictive license which has been
determined to be be non-free and is therefore unsuitable for
inclusion in larger projects that are released under a free
license or a committment to use only free software.  Projects
like Debian and Fedora are in this category.

Any composite product produced by or including JSHint is licensed
under the composition of the strictest terms in all relevant
licenses.  Where the licenses of two products contain terms
that contradict each other, the licenses are incompatible and
the products can't be used or distributed together.

In particular,

- any user or distributor of grunt-contrib-jshint is also
  bound by the "No Evil" clause in JSHint

- Anybody using or distributing a GPL licensed library as part of a
  composite piece of work can't use or distribute JSHint with it and
  therefore can't use/distribute grunt-contrib-jshint either
